# Usage

Fluid Design consists of a pre-packaged set of components that can be used in any React application,
as well as bare-bone code to create and customize your own components.

## Components

To use the components, first install the following dependencies:

<CH.Code>
    
```js npm 
npm install @fluid-design/fluid-ui
```

```js yarn
yarn add @fluid-design/fluid-ui
```

</CH.Code>

Then, you'll need to import the components you want to use:

```js tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  // Add the following to your tailwind.config.js file:
  plugins: [require("@fluid-design/fluid-ui/src/plugin")],
  // Rest of your tailwind.config.js file
};
```

## UI

Fluid UI set is a set of components that can be fully customized to fit your needs.
Instead of wrapping them into a single component, you can use them individually.

<CH.Code>

```js npm
npm install -D tailwindcss
npm install framer-motion @headlessui/react
```

```js yarn
yarn add -D @tailwindcss 
yarn add @framer/framer-motion @headlessui/react
```

</CH.Code>
